# From Portland to Portland
> web_project_3

"From Portland to Portland" (web_project_3) is my second project at Practicum by Yandex. I've done it during the "Adaptive Web Design and Working with Layouts" course. 
In this course, I worked with design specs and turned them into website. I also built interfaces using Grid Layout technology while ensuring that my site looks good on all devices, from desktop computers to smartphones.

## Technologies and Techniques

While developing web_project_3 I used the folowing technologies and techniques:
* Figma - a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based, with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows.
* HTML5, CSS3, markdown
* BEM — Block Element Modifier, a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development
* Visual Studio Code, Git 
* Responsive web design, Semantic markup

## Developing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TanyaKomar/web_project_3.git
cd web_project_3/
```
